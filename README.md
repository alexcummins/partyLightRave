# Party Light Rave

A program to create cool light animations on a WS281x LED string run by a Raspberry Pi.
This project is still a work in progress, and changes have been made while I haven't had access to my LED grid,
so may not currently work!

## Getting Started

You will need a Raspberry Pi and a string/strip of WS281x addressable LEDs.

Follow the Adafruit Neopixel [tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/neopixels-on-raspberry-pi)

Make sure [rpi-ws281x](https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x) library is installed on your Raspberry Pi.

##  Example of use

In a prototype speaker LED box:

## Direction

I'm planning on using the Display interface added to create a GUI/web version so you can 
try out animations on your computer and not exclusively on RPI using LEDDisplay.
